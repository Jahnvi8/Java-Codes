// Kirito is stuck on a level of the MMORPG he is playing now. To move on in the game, he's got to defeat all n dragons that live on this level. 
//   Kirito and the dragons have strength, which is represented by an integer. In the duel between two opponents the duel's outcome is determined by their strength. 
//   Initially, Kirito's strength equals s.

// If Kirito starts duelling with the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) dragon and Kirito's strength is not greater than the dragon's strength xi, then Kirito loses the duel and dies.
//   But if Kirito's strength is greater than the dragon's strength, then he defeats the dragon and gets a bonus strength increase by yi.

// Kirito can fight the dragons in any order. Determine whether he can move on to the next level of the game, that is, defeat all dragons without a single loss.

// Input
// The first line contains two space-separated integers s and n (1 ≤ s ≤ 104, 1 ≤ n ≤ 103). Then n lines follow: the i-th line contains space-separated integers 
// xi and yi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 104, 0 ≤ yi ≤ 104) — the i-th dragon's strength and the bonus for defeating it.

// Output
// On a single line print "YES" (without the quotes), if Kirito can move on to the next level and print "NO" (without the quotes), if he can't.

// Examples
// inputCopy
// 2 2
// 1 99
// 100 0
// outputCopy
// YES
// inputCopy
// 10 1
// 100 100
// outputCopy
// NO
// Note
// In the first sample Kirito's strength initially equals 2. As the first dragon's strength is less than 2, Kirito can fight it and defeat it.
//     After that he gets the bonus and his strength increases to 2 + 99 = 101. Now he can defeat the second dragon and move on to the next level.

// In the second sample Kirito's strength is too small to defeat the only dragon and win.
