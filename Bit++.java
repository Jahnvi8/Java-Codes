// The classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++. This language is so peculiar and complicated.

// The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called x. Also, there are two operations:

// Operation ++ increases the value of variable x by 1.
// Operation -- decreases the value of variable x by 1.
// A statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable x. The statement is written without spaces, that is, 
// it can only contain characters "+", "-", "X". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.

// A programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.

// You're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of x is 0.
// Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).

// Input
// The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.

// Next n lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable x (denoted as letter «X»). 
// Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.

// Output
// Print a single integer — the final value of x.

// Examples
// inputCopy
// 1
// ++X
// outputCopy
// 1
// inputCopy
// 2
// X++
// --X
// outputCopy
// 0
