// "Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the k-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." — an excerpt from contest rules.

// A total of n participants took part in the contest (n ≥ k), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.

// Input
// The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) separated by a single space.

// The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the score earned by the participant who got the i-th place. 
//   The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all i from 1 to n - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: ai ≥ ai + 1).

// Output
// Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.

// Examples
// inputCopy
// 8 5
// 10 9 8 7 7 7 5 5
// outputCopy
// 6
// inputCopy
// 4 2
// 0 0 0 0
// outputCopy
// 0
// Note
// In the first example the participant on the 5th place earned 7 points. As the participant on the 6th place also earned 7 points, there are 6 advancers.

// In the second example nobody got a positive score.
