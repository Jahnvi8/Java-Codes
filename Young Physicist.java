// A guy named Vasya attends the final grade of a high school. One day Vasya decided to watch a match of his favorite hockey team.
//   And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks.
//     Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an
//     idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0).
//       Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. "Piece of cake" — thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0.
//         So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. 
//         Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.

// Input
// The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), then follow n lines containing three integers each: the xi coordinate, 
// the yi coordinate and the zi coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body ( - 100 ≤ xi, yi, zi ≤ 100).

// Output
// Print the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if it is not.

// Examples
// inputCopy
// 3
// 4 1 7
// -2 4 -1
// 1 -5 -3
// outputCopy
// NO
// inputCopy
// 3
// 3 -1 7
// -5 2 -4
// 2 -1 -3
// outputCopy
// YES
