// A penguin Rocher has n sticks. He has exactly one stick with length i for all 1≤i≤n.

// He can connect some sticks. If he connects two sticks that have lengths a and b, he gets one stick with length a+b. 
//   Two sticks, that were used in the operation disappear from his set and the new connected stick appears in his set and can be used for the next connections.

// He wants to create the maximum number of sticks that have the same length. It is not necessary to make all sticks have the same length,
// some sticks can have the other length. How many sticks with the equal length he can create?

// Input
// The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. Next t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

// For each test case, the only line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤109).

// Output
// For each test case, print a single integer  — the answer to the problem.

// Example
// inputCopy
// 4
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// outputCopy
// 1
// 1
// 2
// 2
// Note
// In the third case, he can connect two sticks with lengths 1 and 2 and he will get one stick with length 3. So, he will have two sticks with lengths 3.

// In the fourth case, he can connect two sticks with lengths 1 and 3 and he will get one stick with length 4. After that, he will have three sticks with lengths {2,4,4},
// so two sticks have the same length, and one stick has the other length.
