// Anton's favourite geometric figures are regular polyhedrons. Note that there are five kinds of regular polyhedrons:

// Tetrahedron. Tetrahedron has 4 triangular faces.
// Cube. Cube has 6 square faces.
// Octahedron. Octahedron has 8 triangular faces.
// Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal faces.
// Icosahedron. Icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.
// All five kinds of polyhedrons are shown on the picture below:


// Anton has a collection of n polyhedrons. One day he decided to know, how many faces his polyhedrons have in total. Help Anton and find this number!

// Input
// The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of polyhedrons in Anton's collection.

// Each of the following n lines of the input contains a string si — the name of the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection. The string can look like this:

// "Tetrahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a tetrahedron.
// "Cube" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a cube.
// "Octahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an octahedron.
// "Dodecahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a dodecahedron.
// "Icosahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an icosahedron.
// Output
// Output one number — the total number of faces in all the polyhedrons in Anton's collection.

// Examples
// inputCopy
// 4
// Icosahedron
// Cube
// Tetrahedron
// Dodecahedron
// outputCopy
// 42
// inputCopy
// 3
// Dodecahedron
// Octahedron
// Octahedron
// outputCopy
// 28
// Note
// In the first sample Anton has one icosahedron, one cube, one tetrahedron and one dodecahedron. Icosahedron has 20 faces, cube has 6 faces, 
// tetrahedron has 4 faces and dodecahedron has 12 faces. In total, they have 20 + 6 + 4 + 12 = 42 faces.
