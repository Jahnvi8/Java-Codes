// Recently a new building with a new layout was constructed in Monocarp's hometown. According to this new layout, the building consists of three types of apartments: 
//   three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. It's also known that each room of each apartment has exactly one window. 
//   In other words, a three-room apartment has three windows, a five-room — five windows, and a seven-room — seven windows.

// Monocarp went around the building and counted n windows. Now he is wondering, how many apartments of each type the building may have.

// Unfortunately, Monocarp only recently has learned to count, so he is asking you to help him to calculate the possible quantities of three-room, 
// five-room, and seven-room apartments in the building that has n windows. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

// Here are some examples:

// if Monocarp has counted 30 windows, there could have been 2 three-room apartments, 2 five-room apartments and 2 seven-room apartments, since 2⋅3+2⋅5+2⋅7=30;
// if Monocarp has counted 67 windows, there could have been 7 three-room apartments, 5 five-room apartments and 3 seven-room apartments, since 7⋅3+5⋅5+3⋅7=67;
// if Monocarp has counted 4 windows, he should have mistaken since no building with the aforementioned layout can have 4 windows.
// Input
// Th first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.

// The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤1000) — the number of windows in the building.

// Output
// For each test case, if a building with the new layout and the given number of windows just can't exist, print −1.

// Otherwise, print three non-negative integers — the possible number of three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

// Example
// inputCopy
// 4
// 30
// 67
// 4
// 14
// outputCopy
// 2 2 2
// 7 5 3
// -1
// 0 0 2
