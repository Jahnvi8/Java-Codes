// A first-year student, came to your college. Being a good senior, you must tell him if it is possible to go from College Main Gate to Hostel for him.

// The college can be visualized on a 2D-plane. Suppose the College Main Gate is situated at origin i.e. at the coordinates (0,0) and the Hostel is situated at the coordinates (x,y).

// As the first-year student wants to explore the college campus further, in one move, he will increase or decrease any coordinate (either the x-coordinate or the y-coordinate) by a value of exactly K.

// Is it possible for the first-year student to reach the Hostel?

// Input Format
// First line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the description of the T test case follows.
// Each test case contains one line of input.
// The first line contains three integers x, y, K.
// Output Format
// For each test case, output a single line answer containing a "YES" or "NO" (without quotes).

// You may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings without quotes "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).

// Constraints
// 1≤T≤600
// −1000≤x,y≤1000
// 1≤K≤1000
// Sample Input 1 
// 4
// 1 2 1
// 3 -5 2
// -9 -6 3
// -18 12 5
// Sample Output 1 
// YES
// NO
// YES
// NO
// Explanation
// Test case 1: Here K=1, One of the paths that the first-year student can follow is described as: (0,0) to (1,0) to (1,1) to (1,2). Hence, he can reach the hostel coordinate at (x,y)=(1,2) with the K=1 constraint.

// Test case 2: As here K=2, it can be proved that there is no path to move from (0,0) to (3,−5) by only increasing or decreasing any coordinate by exactly K=2.

// Test case 3: Here K=3, One of the paths that the first-year student can follow is described as: (0,0) to (−3,0) to (−3,−3) to (−3,−6) to (−6,−6) to (−9,−6). Hence, he can reach the hostel coordinate at (x,y)=(−9,−6) with the K=3 constraint.
